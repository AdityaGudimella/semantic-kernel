**Semantic Kernel (SK)** is a lightweight SDK enabling integration of AI Large
Language Models (LLMs) with conventional programming languages. The SK extensible
programming model combines natural language **semantic functions**, traditional
code **native functions**, and **embeddings-based memory** unlocking new potential
and adding value to applications with AI.
